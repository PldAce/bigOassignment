Problem 2: Propose an algorithm to find all nodes less than some value X in a binary min
heap. Analyze its complexity.
The run time complexity would be O(n)
Worst case: When every node is smaller than x, because

Algorithm:
Start at the top(root) of the heap.
if node value >= x, exit 
if value of root < x, print value
Call the method(recurssion) through for both it's left and right child.
