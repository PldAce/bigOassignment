Problem 1: Consider a binary heap. We have a method that print the keys as encountered
in a preorder traversal. Is the output sorted? Justify your answer Attempt the same
question for inorder and postorder traversals. 

If the binary heap is sorted from left to right as least to greatest with no duplicates, 
then it would be sorted if it were printed in preorder. All other cases would be unsorted.
